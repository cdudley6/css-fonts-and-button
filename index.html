<aside>
    <p>Why Mount Flushmore? Well, it's pretty much what it sounds like. A ripoff of Mount Rushmore, but instead of the best of the best, it is made from the worst of the worsts (thus the toilet reference.) Also, similarly to the 4 presidents on Mount Rushmore, mount flushmore consists of the worst four of a certain category </p>

<h2>The List</h2>
<!-- I was afraid to use any images of these jerseys because they did not show up on the stock image website and I don't know copyright rules-->
<p>The NFL is one of the most<em> profitable </em>sports leagues in the entire world. With this money, many teams have been able to make team uniforms that are slick while some even blend some of the traditional roots from their team's history. Unfortunately, not every team has been able to figure this out. Below I have the mount flushmore of jerseys.</p>
    <ol>
       
            <li>Jacksonville Jaguars
        <ul>
            <li>Ugly colors that do not belong on a football jersey</li>
            <li>Poor design that would also look ugly with any colors</li>
        </ul>
            </li>
            <li>New York Jets
        <ul>
            <li>Despite recent changes that have these jerseys trending in the right direction, they still have a hideous color scheme</li>
        </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Indianapolis Colts
        <ul>
            <li>These jerseys just seem like they need to be updated. I also could not really think of another team so I just said the Colts.</li>
        </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Los Angeles Rams
        <ul>
            <li>I feel like the Rams are just trying a little to hard with these jerseys. They are just a few tweaks away from having really beautiful jerseys.</li>
        </ul>
            </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Overall, most NFL jerseys look pretty good so I can even sometimes convince myself that the teams above have good looking jerseys. </p>
